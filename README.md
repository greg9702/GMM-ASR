## Application of Gaussian Mixture Models for feature extraction

Project presenting usage of the GMM method for feature extraction from sepeech signals. <br>
Presented method was compared to MFCC - the the most popular method used currently for this purpose. <br>

### Project structure
- `Data` - directory containing zipped training and test samples
- `Application_of_Gaussian_Mixture_Models_for_fe.pdf` - fake paper, presenting theroretical aspects of speech signals, MFCC and GMM methods
-  `project.ipynb` - notebook containing project code
-  `requirements.txt` - requirements file used for setting up python environment

> All other `.py` contains debug code or code fragments extracted from `.ipynb` for unknown reason :)
